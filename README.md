# Multivariate Analysis Project

This repository contains my coursework and projects for the **Multivariate Analysis** course, showcasing statistical techniques, data exploration, and dimensionality reduction methods.

---

##  Contents

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visual and statistical exploration of datasets to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Techniques such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **Factor Analysis**, **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**, and **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**.

- **Classification & Clustering**  
  Approaches including **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, **QDA**, and various clustering algorithms.

- **Reporting & Visualizations**  
  Detailed analysis reports, visual insights, and interpretation of results.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Statistical Software**: R / Python (specify whichever applies)  
- **Libraries** (examples):  
  - R: `ggplot2`, `FactoMineR`, `MASS`, `caret`  
  - Python: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

##  How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/annamonso/Multivariate-Analysis.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
    # For R
      install.packages(c("ggplot2", "FactoMineR", "MASS", "caret"))
    # Or Python:
      pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. **Explore the analysis**
   Run scripts or open notebooks in each module folder (e.g. PCA/, Clustering/, LDA/)

## Purpose & Value
This project reflects my ability to perform and communicate advanced statistical modeling, including:
  - Summarizing high-dimensional data via dimensionality reduction
  - Identifying patterns and clusters in multivariate datasets
  - Applying classification methods and evaluating results
  - Translating complex data into clear, actionable insights
